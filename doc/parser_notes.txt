Some interesting dialog that should be understandable:

    1. pick up the pick axe
        here we have a compound verb "pick up" and compound noun "pick axe".
        the dictionary must be able to be used based on the work "pick" which
        actually could be defined as a verb also but have a different meaning
        entirely.  other variations of this input could be:
            pick up pick
            grab the pick
            take the axe
            get ax
        many variations should be possible, but the parser should translate all
        the variations to the exact same canonical action.
