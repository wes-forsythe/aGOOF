aGOOF - adventure Game Object-Oriented Framework

aGOOF is a Java framework for building Interactive Fiction games.  The framework
composed of several packages:
        Adventure       : the main package containing only the game entry point.
            GameObject  : the base object for all objects in the framework.
            GameParser  : the scanner/parser for translating input into actions.
            GameEngine  : the game engine that runs all components of the game.
            GameBuild   : the game objects for the specific game.

In addition, more specific objects are found in the packages for constructing 
the different parts of the game:
            Player      : the objects for player state and interaction.
            Creatures   : the objects for non-player characters in the game.
            Locations   : the objects for locations and map building.
            Things      : the objects for different props in the game.
